    object and place it inside the blue basket on the table. Could you please confirm:


    1. Which object should the robot pick up? Is there any particular object you have
    in mind?

    2. Should the robot only pick up one object at a time, or are multiple objects
    allowed?


    Please let me know your preferences so I can create an explicit description of
    the task for the robot.'

    purpose for the robot:


    The robot should move its hand to the position where the red cylinder is located
    on the table. Once there, it should grasp the red cylinder securely. After grasping
    the cylinder, the robot needs to navigate its hand towards the blue basket''s
    location and release the cylinder inside the basket.
