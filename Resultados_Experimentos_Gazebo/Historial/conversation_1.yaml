- content: 'To clarify your request, I assume you want the robot to physically move
    the red cylinder into the blue basket. Here are a few questions to ensure I understand
    correctly:


    1. Are both objects (the cylinder and the basket) initially on the table?

    2. Is it acceptable for the robot to grasp the cylinder directly from its current
    position?

    3. Should the robot place the cylinder inside the basket, or just on top of it?


    Please confirm these details or provide any additional information needed.'

- content: 'Based on your responses, here is a detailed description of the task for
    the robot:


    The robot should first move its hand to the position where the red cylinder is
    located on the table and grasp it securely. Once grasped, the robot should then
    navigate its hand to the location of the blue basket. Finally, the robot must
    release the cylinder inside the basket.


    If this description aligns with your intention, please confirm by replying "Yes,
    that''s what I want." If there are any adjustments needed, let me know!'

    Mission1: [hand_at_red_cylinder, 0.4]

    Drive: ((robot_hand.x_position - object1.x_position)**2 + (robot_hand.y_position
    - object1.y_position)**2)


    Mission2: [red_cylinder_in_hand, 0.6]

    Drive: (1 - robot_hand.state)**2 + ((robot_hand.x_position - object1.x_position)**2
    + (robot_hand.y_position - object1.y_position)**2)


    Mission3: [hand_at_blue_basket, 0.7]

    Drive: ((robot_hand.x_position - object2.x_position)**2 + (robot_hand.y_position
    - object2.y_position)**2)


    Mission4: [red_cylinder_in_blue_basket, 0.8]

    Drive: robot_hand.state**2 + ((object1.x_position - object2.x_position)**2 + (object1.y_position
    - object2.y_position)**2)


    Are these drive functions valid?
