- content: 'To clarify your purpose, I assume you want the robot to pick up a specific
    object and place it into the blue basket on the table. Here are some questions
    to ensure I understand correctly:


    1. Is there a particular object that needs to be picked up for this task?

    2. Should the robot only interact with one specific object, or can it choose any
    available object?

    3. Do you have any preference regarding which hand position (x and y coordinates)
    should be used when placing the object into the basket?


    Please let me know your answers so I can provide a precise description of the
    task for the robot.'

    3. Just into the basket'
  role: user
- content: 'Based on your responses, here''s my understanding:


    The robot should pick up the red cylinder and place it directly into the blue
    basket without any specific hand positioning requirements.


    Here is a detailed description of the task for the robot:


    The robot will first move its hand to the position where the red cylinder is located.
    Once aligned with the cylinder, the robot will grasp it securely. After grasping
    the red cylinder, the robot will then navigate its hand towards the blue basket
    on the table and release the cylinder into the basket.


    Does this description match your intention? If so, please confirm by replying
    "Yes, that''s what I want."'

    Mission1: [red_cylinder_in_hand, 0.5]

    Drive: (robot_hand.x_position - object1.x_position)**2 + (robot_hand.y_position
    - object1.y_position)**2 + (1 - robot_hand.state)


    Mission2: [red_cylinder_in_blue_basket, 0.8]

    Drive: (object1.x_position - object2.x_position)**2 + (object1.y_position - object2.y_position)**2
    + robot_hand.state


    Are these drive functions valid?
