- content: 'To clarify your request, I assume you want the robot to physically move
    the red cylinder into the blue basket. Here are some questions to ensure I understand
    correctly:


    1. Is it important that the cylinder is placed inside the basket rather than just
    on top of it?

    2. Should the robot perform any specific actions after placing the cylinder in
    the basket, such as confirming its position or releasing it gently?


    Please let me know your thoughts so I can refine the task description accurately.'

- content: 'Based on your responses, here is a specific and explicit description of
    the purpose:


    The robot should move its hand to the position where the red cylinder is located,
    grasp the cylinder securely, then transport it to the location of the blue basket.
    Once there, the robot should release the cylinder so that it ends up inside or
    on top of the basket without any additional actions required.


    If this description matches your intention, please confirm with "Yes, that''s
    what I want."'
