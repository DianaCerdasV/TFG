- content: 'To clarify your instructions, I assume you want the robot to perform a
    specific sequence of actions involving two objects: a red cylinder and a blue
    basket. Here''s my understanding:


    1. The robot should identify the red cylinder on the table.

    2. It must move its hand to the position where the red cylinder is located.

    3. Grasp the red cylinder with its hand.

    4. Move the hand holding the red cylinder to the location of the blue basket.

    5. Release the red cylinder into the blue basket.


    Does this sequence accurately reflect your intended purpose? If so, please confirm
    by replying "Yes, that''s what I want." Otherwise, let me know if there are any
    adjustments needed.'

    Final description:


    The robot must first move its hand to the position of the red cylinder on the
    table and grasp it securely. Once grasped, the robot should then navigate its
    hand holding the red cylinder to the location of the blue basket. Finally, the
    robot will release the red cylinder into the blue basket, completing the task.'

    Mission1: [hand_at_red_cylinder, 0.4]

    Drive: (robot_hand.x_position - object1.x_position) ** 2 + (robot_hand.y_position
    - object1.y_position) ** 2


    Mission2: [red_cylinder_in_hand, 0.6]

    Drive: (1 - robot_hand.state) + (robot_hand.x_position - object1.x_position) **
    2 + (robot_hand.y_position - object1.y_position) ** 2


    Mission3: [hand_with_red_cylinder_at_blue_basket, 0.7]

    Drive: (1 - robot_hand.state) + (robot_hand.x_position - object2.x_position) **
    2 + (robot_hand.y_position - object2.y_position) ** 2


    Mission4: [red_cylinder_in_blue_basket, 0.8]

    Drive: robot_hand.state + (object1.x_position - object2.x_position) ** 2 + (object1.y_position
    - object2.y_position) ** 2


    Are these drive functions valid?
