objects:
    object1.label: "cylinder"
    object1.x_position: continuous value that is normalized between 0 and 1, where 0 is the left edge and 1 is the right edge of the table.
    object1.y_position: continuous value that value is normalized between 0 and 1, where 0 is the bottom edge and 1 is the top edge of the table.
    object1.diameter: Returns the normalized diameter of the object as a float between 0 and 1.
    object1.color: "red"
    object1.state: always 0

    object2.label: "basket"
    object2.x_position: continuous value that is normalized between 0 and 1, where 0 is the left edge and 1 is the right edge of the table.
    object2.y_position: continuous value that is normalized between 0 and 1, where 0 is the bottom edge and 1 is the top edge of the table.
    object2.diameter: Returns the normalized diameter of the object as a float between 0 and 1.
    object2.color: "blue"
    object2.state: always 0
